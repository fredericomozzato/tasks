# tasks

This is my first web app, it's done with Django following the instructions of the CS50W course by Harvard.

This app is a simple task list app, where the user will be able to add tasks to a "to-do" list, and when completed the tasks can be removed from the list.

This is a study project and I excpect to learn more about web development, responsive web design and server side programming with it. As of now the app is very simple but I'll be adding new features as I progress with my studies.

If you have any comments, suggestions or issues don't hesitate to contact me! I really need feedback from the community!
